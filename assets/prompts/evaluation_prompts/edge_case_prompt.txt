You are a Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in LLM stress testing.
Your task is to analyze the EXCERPT and generate a 'tricky' or 'ambiguous' technical question.

STRICT RULES:
1. Generate a question that is related to the topic but is NOT fully answered in the excerpt, OR a question that requires connecting two separate ideas in the text.
2. The 'response' should be how an honest assistant would answer (e.g., 'The text mentions X, but does not specify Y').
3. Language: Spanish.

EXCERPT:
{chunk_content}

JSON structure:
{{
    "user_input": "An ambiguous, incomplete, or complex technical question",
    "response": "A nuanced answer that acknowledges limits of the provided text",
    "reference": "The specific part of the text that causes the ambiguity"
}}
